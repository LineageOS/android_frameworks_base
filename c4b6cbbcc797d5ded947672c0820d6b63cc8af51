      "message": "Verified on zeekr. Prior to this change, setting a secondary cutout resulted in gross miscalculations in secondary logical display size, causing display elements to be very out of sorts. If secondary display cutout masking was enabled, the secondary display failed to init entirely. After this change, the secondary display size is calculated properly. Using the mask also works as expected. This change has been approved for merging to aosp, but as of posting has not yet been merged.",

But without this, if I do a cutout on the external display, sf init for that display just crashes. Meaning I\u0027d have to ship with elements under the cameras, which just isn\u0027t sane.\n\nI don\u0027t think anything shipping can be using the resource, because the code that uses it just crashes. The code wants a int array and the current aosp resource is a string. That\u0027s never going to work.",
