      "message": "Verified on zeekr. Prior to this change, setting a secondary cutout resulted in gross miscalculations in secondary logical display size, causing display elements to be very out of sorts. If secondary display cutout masking was enabled, the secondary display failed to init entirely. After this change, the secondary display size is calculated properly. Using the mask also works as expected. This change has been approved for merging to aosp, but as of posting has not yet been merged.",

My comments aren\u0027t about anything using this specific array.\n\nThey\u0027re about any proprietary apk which relies on `framework-res` resources. This patch affects the entire platform, it _might_ change IDs, and that _may_ lead to crashes on such devices. \n\nIt\u0027s solely due to doing any edits to `framework-res`. There\u0027s a reason we don\u0027t edit it.\n\nNow maybe I\u0027m being overly cautious, but I\u0027d rather not have the nightlies after this just break. At least not when what I\u0027m trying to say isn\u0027t coming across at all.\n\n\nSo,\n\n1. Does this change affect the IDs of resources in `framework-res`?\n2. What devices would this affect?",
