The current issues are:\n* There is slight wallpaper distortion on touch down (which we had before).\n* UI elements appearing dark, more so on low brightness conditions which seems inevitable.\n* The dimming array could be slightly better (Based on the noticeable brightness shifts on operating the QS) but its certainly improved.\n* Dim layer is not brought up on doze pulse.",
